# MAAD
This is my code for my MAAD projects

Week 1) Chuck a bunch of ping pong balls around a maze and try to see which ones come out

Week 2) Combines gifs, it made me laugh

Week 3) Needed to make something with a gif of an imposter doing a dance, and the words soothing + saturated. Well, the imposter gets progressively saturated so that answers the saturated part, and your computer will crash eventually causing you to reflect on life and be soothed by the environment....
